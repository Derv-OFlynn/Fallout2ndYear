### <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Agile Methodologies:</mark>

- Traditional IS development methodologies "are treated primarily as a necessary fiction to represent an image of control or to provide a symbolic status"

- Lightweight alternative to traditional heavyweight processes

- Began with introduction of extreme programming (XP) by Beck in 1999.

- Agile manifesto in 2001

- A number of other methods have been invented or rediscovered since

- However, no clear agreement on how to distinguish Agile from Traditional Methodologies

- <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Agile values:</mark>

    - Individuals and interactions over tools and processes

    - Working software over comprehensive documentation - continuously turn out working tested software

    - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

    - Responding to change rather than following a plan - adaptive rather than prescriptive

- <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Agile characteristics & principles:</mark>

    - Satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software

    - Incremental and timebound with short iteration cycles from 1 to 6 weeks

    - Development group consists of both software developers and customer representatives. Regular feedback is given to developers. Authorised to consider adjustments during developments.

    - Working software is the primary measure of progress

    - What is new is the recognition of people as the primary drivers of project success along with intense focus and manoeuvrability

    - Fully automated regression testing testing

    - Experienced developers - speeds up project by a factor anywhere from 2 to 10 times

    - Minimal process overheads, remove unnecessary process activities

    - Modelling tools are not as useful as generally thought

    - Continuous attention to technical excellence, e.g. refactoring in XP

    - At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly

- <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Agile methodologies:</mark>

    - Extreme Programming (XP)

    - Scrum

    - Crystal

    - Feature driven development

    - UP?

- <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">XP Lifecycle:</mark>

    - <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Exploration Phase:</mark>

        - Customers write story cards for first release

        - Each story card describes features of system (like a brief use-case)

        - Project team familiarise themselves with tools, technology and practices they use in the project.

        - Try out tools and explore possibilities for architecture via prototyping

        - Phase can take from a few weeks to a few months

        - Set priorities from a few weeks to a few months

    - <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Planning phase:</mark>

        - Set priority for stories

        - Agree contents of first small release

        - Estimate effort for each story and agree schedule

        - First release normally not more than two months

        - Planning phase itself takes a couple of days

    - <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Iterations to Release Phase:</mark>

        - Several iterations from 1 to 4 weeks

        - First iteration creates a system with architecture for the whole system

        - Select story that will enforce building of structure for whole system

        - Customer selects stories for each iteration

        - Functional tests created by customer run at the end of each iteration

    - <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Productioning Phase:</mark>

        - Requires extra testing and performance checking before being released to a customer

        - New changes may still be found

        - Shorter iterations

    - <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Maintenance and Death Phase:</mark>

        - Keep system in production while producing new increments

        - Requires effort for customer support tasks

        - Development speeds may slow

        - Maybe incorporate new people into team

        - Death phase - no more stories to be implemented, or if system not delivering desired outcomes or is proving too expensive for development

- <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">XP Roles:</mark>

    - <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Programmer</mark>

    - <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Customer</mark> - writes stories and functional tests

    - <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Tester</mark> - gives feedback on schedule to team

    - <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Coach</mark> - has sound understanding of XP

    - <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Consultant</mark> - specific technical knowledge

    - <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Manager</mark>

- <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">XP Practices:</mark>

    - Planning game

    - Small short releases

    - <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Simple design</mark> - simplest possible design that is implementable at the moment

    - Testing - development is test driven. Unit tests are implemented before code and run continuously. Customers write functional tests

    - Refactoring

    - Pair programming

    - <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Collective ownership</mark> - anyone can change any part any time.

    - Continuous integration - new piece of code integrated into code-base as soon as it is ready. System integrated and built many times daily. All tests run and have to be passed for change to be accepted.

    - 40 hour week

    - On site customer

    - Open workspace

- <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">XP - Scope of Use:</mark>

    - Small to medium sized teams, 3 to 20 project members

    - Communication between members at all times, even scattering across two floors is not acceptable

    - Any resistance by team members, management or customers may fail the process

    - Growing research

- <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Scrum:</mark>

    - Developed for managing the Systems Development process.

    - No specific software development technique, can be adopted to manage an organisation's own engineering practices

    - Focuses on flexibility of team members in producing software in a constantly changing environment

    - Frequent management activities to identify and rectify any impediments in the development process

    - Suitable for small teams of less than 10.

    - Development relies on several Environmental and technical variables which are likely to change

        - Requirements

        - Time frame

        - Resources

        - Technology

        - Development Methods

- <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Scrum Lifecycle:</mark>

    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/Zef2rMa.png)


- <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Scrum - 3 phases:</mark>

    - Pregame phase, which consists of 2 sub-phases

        - Planning

        - Architecture and High-level design

    - Development or Game Phase

    - Postgame phase

- <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Pregame planning sub-phase:</mark>

    - <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Product Backlog list:</mark>

        - All requirements that are currently know

        - Prioritised

        - Development effort estimated

    - Includes definition of team, tools and other resources

    - Risk Assessment

    - Training needs

- <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Pre-game architecture sub-phase:</mark>

    - High level design of system including architecture planned based on current Product Backlog

    - For enhancement to an existing system, changes needed for implementing backlog are identified along with any problems they may cause.

    - Design review meetings are held to go over proposals. Decisions are made on the basis of this review

- <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Development or Game Phase:</mark>

    - Agile part of Scrum, unpredictable expected.

    - System developed in Sprints

        - Iterative cycles where functionality is developed or enhanced to produce new increments.

        - Included traditional development activities of analysis, design, implementation, delivery

        - A Sprint is planned to last from 1 week to 1 month

        - Could be 3 to 8 sprints in a system development process before ready for distribution.

    - Environment and technical variables are observed and controlled during sprints, not just at beginning.

- <mark style="background:#69E7E4;">Postgame Phase:</mark>

    - Entered when agreement reached that

    - environmental variables such as requirements

    - are completed

    - System ready for release
