	'The Right to Privacy' Harvard Law Review of 1890
	    
	Warren and Brandeis complained that:
    "The press is overstepping in every direction the obvious bounds of propriety and of decency. Gossip is no longer the resource of the idle and of the vicious, but has become a trade, which is pursued with industry as well as effrontery. To satisfy a prurient taste the details of sexual relations are spread broadcast in the columns of the daily papers. To occupy the indolent, column upon column is filled with idle gossip, which can only be procured by intrusion upon the domestic circle."
    
    Central thrust of the article: <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">common law should protect 'privacy'</mark>
        
    Referred to Mr Justice Cooley
        'right to be left alone' 2 years earlier
        "The common law has always recognized a man 's house as his castle, impregnable, Often even to its own officers engaged in the execution Of its commands. Shall the courts thus close the front entrance to constituted authority, and open wide the back door to idle or prurient curiosity?'

        - The rights of privacy and freedom of expression are both fundamental
        - In media cases they are often in direct conflict.
        - The theoretical problem of the "balancing of rights" is a pressing practical issue for editors as well as media lawyers.
        
        - <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Campbell v. Mirror Group Newspapers ([2004] UKHL):</mark>
            
            - First opportunity post UK Human Rights Act 1998
            - Daily Mirror discovered that, despite her public denial of drug use, Ms Campbell was secretly attending meetings of Narcotics Anonymous and published an article and an photo
            
        - <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Court Analysed the Article:</mark>
            
            - <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Five elements of private material:</mark>
                - the fact of Ms Campbell's drug addiction;
                - the fact that she was receiving treatment for that addiction;
                - the fact that she was receiving treatment at Narcotics Anonymous;
                - details of that treatment and her reaction to it; and
                - surreptitiously obtained photographs of her emerging from a treatment session.
                
            - <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Two fundamental issues arose:</mark>
                - Extent of unjustified publication of private information protection?
                - How to reconcile with the right to freedom of expression?
                
            - <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Private Information:</mark>
                - In relation to the first issue, the Court recognised that breach of confidence should be expanded so as to provide a remedy for the unjustified publication of personal information.
                - Held: the Human Rights Act 1998 now meant the law of confidence has absorbed the values protected by Article 8 (privacy) and Article 10 (expression).
                - Private protection should be determined by applying an objective test of "reasonable expectation of privacy".
                - Lord Hoffmann: 'a photograph of humiliation or severe embarrassment may infringe. '
                
            - <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Balancing rights:</mark>
                - Held that Article 8 and 10 rights should be balanced by applying the principle of proportionality.
                - Neither right takes precedence over the other.
                - It was recognised both that some types of speech are of greater value than others and that there are different degrees of privacy.
                - 3-2 Decision in Campbell's favour
                    - details of therapeutic treatment for addiction was private
                    - disclosure could interfere with or disrupt her treatment
                    
                
            - <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Campbell's legacy:</mark>
                - Does not prevent publication about the private lives of politicians or celebs.
                - Does require a more rigorous approach to deciding publication
                - Suggested approach:
                - consider whether publication contains material which has a reasonable expectation of privacy.
                - If so, consider whether a "public interest" defence exists for this.
                - If such a defence does not apply to each element,
                - Then necessary to consider how private the information is and what type of speech is involved.
                - If information is 'intimate', publication must have some political and democratic value to justify its publication.
                - Photographs should be considered separately.
                - Where they depict humiliating or embarrassing events or have been obtained surreptitiously, then publication will be difficult to justify.

        - <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Digitally stored databases and records:</mark>
            
            - Digital records are intangible, no physical weight and can be <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">lost or stolen without indication</mark>
            - Such a loss could represent an enormous amount of value
            
        - <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Earliest information protection was driven by the professions rather than the law:</mark>
            
            - e.g. Lawyer-client <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">privilege</mark> became a sort of contract between a lawyer and client over the centuries
            - Allowing the lawyer to represent their clients' interests without the client fearing legal repercussions
            - e.g. Medical records and a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">doctors confidentiality</mark> were established
            - Though a court could force those records to be handed over, the medical profession otherwise kept them relatively safe.
            - These practices ensured specific <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">silos</mark> of personal information were protected according to the interests of the business.
            - Where a business value existed then information was protected.
            
        - <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Change:</mark>
            - Moving from paper to electronics meant more varied & powerful methods for manipulating personal information.
            - This means greater risks!
            - e.g. Political campaigns have used increasing volumes of data to better target key demographics, define policy, manage candidates' image etc.
            - Campaigns targeted states based on historical notions of which states were "swing" i.e., could go either way and budget realities.
            - Campaigns also use data to construct predictive models to make targeting campaign communications more efficient and to support broader campaign strategies.
            - These predictive models result in three categories of "predictive scores" for each citizen in the voter database: behaviour scores, support scores, and responsiveness scores.

                - Reflected the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">minimum standards</mark> specified in the convention,
                - <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Not rigorous in 1988.</mark> Requirements for the protection of personal data were considerably less urgent than today
                - The <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">power and availability</mark> of computers exploded during the 80s and 90s,
                - EU Member States' data protection <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">laws diverged</mark>, thus impeding data flows through the European Union — and thus impeding business.

            - Established <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">rules for transporting data</mark> outside of the EU. e.g. US-EU Safe Harbour framework
            - Which asserted that US data protection laws were sufficient for the protection of personal data originating in the EU, as long as the recipient in the US observed a set of data protection principles-

            - Enacted the requirements of the DPD
            - Found on 8 principles
	            - 1. Obtain and process information fairly.
	            - 2. The data must be kept for a specified, lawful purpose-
	            - 3. The data should be used and disclosed only for the specified purpose-
	            - 4. The data must be kept safe and secure.
	            - 5. The data must be up to date, accurate and complete.
	            - 6. The data must be relevant, adequate but not excessive.
	            - 7. The data must be retained for no longer than is necessary
	            - 8. A copy of the data must be made available to the data subject, on request
            
            - These principles clearly laid out the general aims of the Act, which made it reasonably simple to determine whether an organisation was meeting its obligations.
            - There was some complexity in the broader Act, however, and repeated amendments and updates meant that it continued to grow and become more unwieldy as time went on.
            
        - <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Misalignment:</mark>
            
            - Across the EU, other, similar legislation was enacted, but through a combination of time and varying national interests, no two national laws were sufficiently similar for an organisation to simultaneously be compliant in its home country and across all the other EU member states.
            - That is, the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">free flow</mark> of information was effectively <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">inhibited</mark> because the different regulatory environments clashed on matters of detail, requiring businesses and governments alike to arrange processes specific to an increasing array of scenarios.

    - <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Supervisory Authority (DPA):</mark> 'supervisory authority' means an independent public authority which is established by a Member State pursuant to Article 51 most cases, the supervisory authority will be the authority currently responsible for data protection measures. In Ireland, it is the Data Protection Commissioner's Office.
	
	
* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Principles (Art 5.1 Personal Data must be:</mark>
	* Processed lawfully, fairly and transparently. 
	* Can only be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes. 
	* Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for processing. accurate and kept up to date. 
	* Kept in a form such that the data subject can be identified only as long as is necessary for processing. 
	* Processed in a manner that ensures its security.
	 
* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Applicability:</mark>
	
	* Organisations within and outwith the EU. Extensive reach for liable in the event of a data breach.
	* Potentially protects information of all "natural persons, whatever their nationality or place of residence"
	* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Personal data</mark> is information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject' DS). An identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier, such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;
	* This extended list of identifiable characteristics means that a great deal of anonymised data may no longer be suitable for distribution or sharing in public. Organisations that distribute anonymised data need to carefully assess whether the data can be linked — directly or indirectly — to the DS
	
* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Data Subjects' Rights:</mark>
	
	* Increases the rights for DS. Balancing DS rights vs right to the free flow of data to support "the pursuit of economic activities".
	* Organisations must ensure that they know what data they collect and how they use data. Restrictive rules exist on what can be done without specific consent.
	* DS can seek judicial remedies against DC & DP. Also have the right to seek compensation for damages arising from any breaches. Gives DCS vested interest in ensuring the security of any personal data that they pass to a processor.
	
	* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Consent:</mark>
		* Generally, DC needs DS's consent to process their data. Limited circumstances where consent is not necessary e.g. (1) generally revolve around legal requirements (such as in compliance with another law, or to protect the rights of DS), (2) DS consent is provided through a contract they have with a third party. 
		* Consent must be clear and unambiguous consent before processing personal data. "Silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity" are NOT consent. Processing cannot proceed unless DS has consented to every processing activity
		* If you wish to carry out six different actions with the subject's data, for instance, you need to ensure that the subject has consented to all of them.
		* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Children under 16:</mark> Organisations need to obtain consent from the "holder of parental responsibility'. 
		* Consent possible with a tick-box, but consent document must be laid out in simple terms. "the request must be clear, concise and not unnecessarily disruptive to the use of the service for which it is provided'.
		* Consent can be <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">withdrawn</mark>. DC must provide a method that is "as easy to withdraw consent as to give it'.
		
	
* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Right to be forgotten:</mark>
	
	* (1) to have data erased under a number of circumstances 
	* (2) also must occur if DS withdraw consent for all of the processing for which the data is held. 
	* Must take <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">"reasonable steps"</mark> to erase any of the DS's data that might be public, such as in news articles or databases. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Data Commissioner (DPA)</mark> will want to see that all appropriate technical and procedural measures to erase the data have been employed.
	
* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Data Portability:</mark>
	* DSs can request a copy of any personal data held on them, and can also request that this information is transmitted to another data controller. Must be <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">"structured, commonly used and machine-readable format"</mark>.
	* Some organisations will already have appropriate contact with other organisations to facilitate the transfer of data — e.g banks — and these contacts could be leveraged to streamline this process.
	
* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Lawful Processing:</mark>
	
	* Expanded in Article 6: 
		* (1) DS must have given consent or 
		* (2) processing is necessary for certain tasks, majority, require consideration of the data subject's interests. 
		
	* Permissible where "necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child".
	* Essentially makes lawful any reasonable processing in line with an organisation's interests, but must ensure that it does not otherwise threaten the interests, rights or freedoms of the data subject, is not in contravention of some other law or regulation and is "necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller"
	* Will need to ensure that any processing without consent (or falling under one of the other stipulated conditions) is clearly permissible as part of the public interest.
	* In most cases, It will be simpler and safer to secure consent
	* Data can only be processed for limited purposes, to a minimal extent and accurately.
	* Tied to the requirement for <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">transparency</mark> the data subject must be aware of the nature of the processing, which will inform the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">'limited purposes'</mark>and <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">'minimal extent'</mark>
	* Processing special categories of data (e.g. ethnicity, sexual orientation, health, etc.) is explicitly forbidden except in very specific circumstances.
	
* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Retention of data:</mark>
	
	* DS's right to be forgotten, hence the DC must erase all information held on them. Data can also only be retained for limited periods, which should be clear to the data subject at the point at which they consent. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">NOT</mark> a hard and fast rule as some data could be held effectively indefinitely (e.g. public bodies for specific governmental purposes). 
	* While holding data, confidentiality and integrity must be secured - including against accidental loss, destruction or damage. Should be an extremely high priority for every organisation e.g. due to compulsory data breach reporting.
	
* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">"One-stop shop":</mark>
	
	* GDPR intended to be a single scheme across the EU, to maintain a common market and support the free flow of information. 
	* EU Data Protection Board (EDPB) created to ensure that laws remain relatively consistent and with minimal impact on commerce.
	* Member state will have Data Protection Authorities (DPA point of contact for GDPR issues). Intended to reduce the bureaucratic load for organisation dealing with data protection, anonymity and so on.
	* Organisations will deal with the DPA in their primary jurisdiction. This will cover all cross-border intra-EU data processing.
	
* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Records of Data Processing:</mark>
	
	* DC must retain record of its data processing activities.
	* Record needs to contain e.g. types of data is being processed, where it is processed, how it is processed and why it is processed. 
	* DP also required to keep a record of all processing carried out on behalf of DC
	* Records can be called upon by DPA at any time.
	
* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Data Protection Impact Assessments:</mark>
	
	* Mandatory for technologies and processes that are likely to result in a high risk to the rights of data subjects.
	* DC should ensure that a DPIA is part of their risk assessment process regarding personal data, and is in line with their <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">data protection by design and by default</mark> strategies.
	* Single DPIA can cover a set of similar processing operations with comparable risks. DPIAs can be outsourced
	
* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Data Protection by design and by default:</mark>
	
	* DPIAs usually relate to design phase of an application or process.
	* GDPR makes mandatory <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">'privacy by design'</mark>. At the initial design stage, if any of processing could result in a loss of data protection, and have not been addressed "by design and by default', then likely to be held liable in the event of a data breach. 
	* GDPR is technology neutral and does not specify how much security should apply, nor the specific measures to use — but a requirement <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">"implement appropriate technical and organisational measures"</mark>. 
	* Need to be able to prove to DPA that data protection was taken into consideration from the beginning.
	* Where the risks were too great and then the processing should not take place. That is considering the state of the art, and a key part of <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">data protection by default</mark>.
	
* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">DC/DP contracts:</mark>
	
	* DP must provide <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">"sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures"</mark> to comply with GDPR ensuring DS's rights are protected. 
	* Requirement moves down the supply chain, DP cannot engage a second DP without DP's explicit authorisation. Also, 2nd DP has to supply the same guarantees. 
	* Contractual arrangements must be reviewed and updated. Ensure that responsibilities and liabilities between DC and DP are defined. Must document responsibilities to ensure no confusion, and may have to accept that the increased risk levels and requirements for data protection measures may impact service costs.
	* Certifications to international standards, e.g. ISO 27001 are recognised as effective to demonstrate appropriate technical and organisational measures have been implemented.
