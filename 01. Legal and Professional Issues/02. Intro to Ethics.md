        - A trolley is running out of control down a track. In its path are five people who have been tied to the track by a mad philosopher. Fortunately, you could flip a switch which will lead the trolley down a single track to safety. Unfortunately, there is a single person tied to that track. Should you flip the switch or do nothing?

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Scenario 2:</mark>

        - ![](local://C:/Users/dervl/remnote/remnote-644bbf51117a5271f76257fc/files/R_qx5T6eIlJHguwOgi8s7HGHZA6v2w8CHDRpQPDpGD2KSBYrplQ-ciTvC6BV23Bajy4oHs-RTdS69bA9w5CwOWZq6WXl3FJPM0kOLXi1E_jIH622vIKZne7spq7ug6xU.png)

        - As before, a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. You are on a bridge under which it will pass, and you can stop it by dropping a heavy weight in front of it. As it happens, there is a very fat man next to you - your only way to stop the trolley is to push him over the bridge and onto the track, killing him to save five. Should you proceed?

- <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Overview:</mark>

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">The Ethical Point of view:</mark>

        - Virtually everybody shares "core values": Life, happiness, ability to accomplish goals

        - Two ways to view the world:

            - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Selfish point of view:</mark> consider only own self and its core values

            - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Ethical point of view:</mark> respect other people and their core values

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Defining Terms:</mark>

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Society:</mark> Association of people organised under a system of rules

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Rules:</mark> Advance the good of members over time

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Morality:</mark> A society's rules of conduct e.g. competition. What people ought/ought not to do in various situations (what about conscription?)

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Ethics:</mark> Rational examination of morality, evaluation of people's behaviour

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Why Ethics?</mark>

        - Not everyone can do what they want

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Ethics:</mark> A way to decide the best thing to do

        - New problems accompany new technologies: Email Vs. Spam, Libraries Vs. WWW ads

        - "Common wisdom" is not always adequate

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">More on ethics:</mark>

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Ethics:</mark> rational, systematic analysis

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">"Doing Ethics":</mark> answers need explanation

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Explanations:</mark> facts, shared values, logic

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Ethics:</mark> Voluntary, rational choices

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Workable ethical theory:</mark> Produces explanations that might be persuasive to a sceptical, yet open-minded audience

- <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Subjective Relativism:</mark>

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Relativism:</mark>

        - No universal norms of right and wrong

        - One person can say "X is right", another can say "X is wrong" and both can be right

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Subjective Relativism (SR):</mark> Each person decides what is right and wrong for themselves

        - "What's right for you may not be right for me"

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Case for Subjective Relativism:</mark>

        - Well-meaning and intelligent people disagree on moral issues

        - Ethical debates a disagreeable and pointless

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Case Against Subjective Relativism:</mark>

        - Blurs distinction between doing what you think is right and doing what you want to do.

        - It makes no moral distinction between the actions of different people

        - Some may say "I can do what I want so long as I don't harm others" but then we must agree a meaning for harm.

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Tolerance</mark> is a vital ingredient for a modern, peaceful and pluralistic society

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">SR</mark> and <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Tolerance</mark> are often equated, however they are two different things. People ought to be tolerant (Universal Rule). However, SR says there should be no universal rules.

        - Decisions may not be based on reason e.g. Tarot cards or dice rolling

        - Not a workable ethical theory as it would not persuade others in justification

- <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Cultural Relativism:</mark>

    - What is "right" and "wrong" depends upon a society's actual moral guidelines

    - Anthropologists have identified "folkways"

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Morality</mark> of a group is the sum of taboos and prescriptions

        - These guidelines vary from place to place and from time to time

        - A particular action may be right in one society at one time and wrong in another society or at another time

    - Hampden-Turner/Trompenaars study on right and wrong of driving dilemma in 46 countries

    - ![](local://C:/Users/dervl/remnote/remnote-644bbf51117a5271f76257fc/files/2BWOjvSML2yA90lSEChp7bFBXTEjMc-5bQY_rvQ7o3rjq7eBcqc3Xuz4E_pLGCGs5ch3QxgOIu2cALU6U38z_o_ET6B8Zx8JR-dXmp66tjTm-tc-xy0Y_bGBPDF7FTfx.png)

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Case for Cultural Relativism:</mark>

        - Different social contexts demand different moral guidelines, e.g. humans have moved from survival to mass production (pollution, common fisheries)

        - It is arrogant for one society to judge another. A modern person cannot fairly judge someone in the 15th century

        - Morality is reflected in actual behaviour, "do as I say, not as I do"

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Case against Cultural Relativism:</mark>

        - Because two societies do have different moral views doesn't mean they ought to have different views (In a drought, is it more correct to construct an aqueduct or sacrifice humans)

        - It doesn't explain how moral guidelines are determined

        - Doesn't explain how guidelines evolve.

            - Consider the integration of US universities.

            - Rosa Parks was legally wrong but morally right

        - Provides no way out for cultures in conflict, consider the Gaza conflict

        - Because many practices are acceptable does not mean any cultural practice is acceptable (many/any fallacy)

        - Societies share certain core values in order to survive (possible basis for universal value system)

            - Caring for new-borns

            - Telling the truth

            - Prohibition against murder

        - Only indirectly based on reason ⇒ not a workable ethical theory

- <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Divine Command Theory:</mark>

    - Three great monotheist religions emerged from the Middle East (Torah)

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Good actions:</mark> Those aligned with god's will

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Bad actions:</mark> Those contrary to god's will

    - Holy books reveal god's will

    - We should use holy books as moral decision-making guides

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Case for Divine Command Theory:</mark>

        - We owe obedience to our creator

        - God is all-good and all-knowing

        - God is the ultimate authority

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Case Against Divine Command Theory:</mark>

        - Different holy books disagree. Even within Christianity, a number of Old Testament books differ

        - Society is multicultural, multi-faith, atheist and secular

        - Some moral problems not addressed in signature, may rely on analogy, but whose analogy?

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">God is good:</mark>

            - "The good" ≠ "God" (equivalence fallacy)

            - Plato said "The gods love piety because it is pious, and it is not pious because they love it."

            - "good" is an objective standard otherwise it becomes arbitrary

            - Can "good" be discussed without God's command to be good? Yes, if it is an objective "good"

            - Based on obedience, not reason (Consider the story of Abraham and his son)

- <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;"></mark>Ethical Egoism:<mark style="background:#FF5582A6;"></mark>

    - Contrasting "Love your neighbour as yourself", ethical egoism is the philosophy that each person should focus exclusively on their own self interest

    - The morally right action for a person to take in a particular situation is the action that will provide that will provide that person with the maximum long term benefit

    - Ethical Egoism does not prohibit acting to help someone else, but assisting another thing to do and only if it is in the helper's own long-term best interest

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Case for Ethical Egoism:</mark>

        - Ethical Egoism is a practical moral philosophy.

            - We're inclined to do what's best for ourselves.

            - Let other people take care of themselves, we can't know what's best for them

            - Often, a "good deed" brings more harm than good

            - Dependence upon the charity of others leads to a loss of self-esteem

        - The community can benefit when individuals put their well-being first e.g. successful entrepreneurs may get rich but also create jobs and wealth for others

        - Other morals principles are rooted in the principle of self-interest

            - Can deduce from long terms consequences of behaviours, e.g. it doesn't make sense to go around breaking promises

            - Also, a bad idea to lie to other people or cheat other people

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Case against Ethical Egoism:</mark>

        - An easy moral philosophy may not be the best moral philosophy. People often find it difficult to pass up short-term pleasures against their long-term benefit

        - We do know a lot about what is good for someone else

            - Practically everyone shares the "core values", not that hard to know how to help each other

            - Charity usually doesn't lead to dependence, e.g. a scholarship

        - Other moral principles are superior to the principle of self-interest

            - e.g. an opportunity to save a drowning person at the cost of getting one of your shirtsleeves wet

            - EE: save a life if it's in your self interest, e.g. publicity

            - Doesn't it make a lot more sense to consider the action in light of the value of a human life?

        - People who take the good of others into account live happier lives. Studies show that happiness spreads through close relationships: family, friends and neighbours

        - EE does not recognise that in order to reap the benefits of living in community, individuals must consider the good of other community members. We reject ethical egoism as a workable ethical theory

- <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Kantianism:</mark>

    - Allows only universal rules that can be <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">rationalised</mark>, e.g. explains why an action is right or wrong

    - Identifies <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">good will</mark> as the desire to do the right thing

    - Immanuel Kant: begins with the question

        - What is always good without qualification?

        - What about intelligence, strength, courage?

        - The only thing in the world that is good without qualification is a "good will", even if the end result is not achieved.

    - Reason should cultivate desire to do the right thing (not what we should like to do)

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Dutifulness</mark> - (deontological ethics), our will should be grounded in a conception of <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">moral rules</mark>

    - The moral value of an action depends upon the underlying moral rule. It is critical, therefore, that we be able to determine if our actions are grounded in an appropriate moral rule

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">What makes a moral rule appropriate?</mark>

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Categorical Imperative (1st formulation):</mark>

            - Act only from moral rules that you can at the same time will to be universal moral laws

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Illustration of 1st Formulation:</mark>

            - Question: can a person in dire straits make a promise with the intention of breaking it later?

            - Proposed rule: "I may make promises with the intention of later breaking them"

            - The person in trouble wants his promise to be believed so he can get what he needs

            - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Proposed Universal Rule:</mark> Everyone may make false promises (when in difficult situations).

                - Everyone breaking promises would make promises unbelievable, contradicting desire to have promise believed.

                - This rule is flawed, a contradiction, absurd

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Categorical Imperative (2nd Formulation):</mark>

            - Act so that you treat both yourself and other people in themselves and never only as a means to and end.

            - This is usually an easier formulation to work with than the first formulation.

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Case for Kantianism:</mark>

        - Rational and intuitively agreeable and fair

        - Can produce a "why" for a given rule

        - Produces universal moral guidelines, e.g. human sacrifice is wrong and was always wrong

        - Treats all persons as moral equals

        - Workable ethical theory

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Case against Kantianism:</mark>

        - Sometimes no rule adequately characterises an action, e.g. stealing to provide for a starving family

        - Depends on characterising the proposed rule properly

        - If we allow for multiple rules to characterise an action, then there may be no way to resolve a conflict between rules

        - Kant explained his framework to include:

            - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Perfect duties:</mark> e.g. don't lie, don't steal

            - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Imperfect duties:</mark> e.g. help others, develop your talents

            - In conflicts, <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">perfect duties</mark> must prevail. What if there is conflict between perfect duties?

        - Kantianism does not allow any bending of perfect duties

        - Still workable for our purposes

- <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Utilitarianism:</mark>

    - Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill

    - An action is <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">good</mark> if it benefits someone

    - An action is <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">bad</mark> if it harms someone

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Utility:</mark> Tendency of an object to produce happiness or prevent unhappiness for an individual or a community

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Happiness</mark> = advantage = benefit = good = pleasure

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Unhappiness</mark> = disadvantage = cost = evil = pain

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Principle of Utility (Greatest Happiness Principle):</mark>

        - An action is right (or wrong) to the extent that it increases or decreases the total happiness of the affected parties

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Utilitarianism</mark> says that the morality of an action has nothing to do with intent

            - Focuses on the consequences

            - A consequentialist theory

            - Allows is expanded to cover affected beings

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Bentham: Weighing Pleasure/Pain</mark>

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Intensity:</mark> magnitude of the experience

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Duration:</mark> how long does it last

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Certainty:</mark> probability of the experience occurring

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Propinquity:</mark> how close the experience is in space and time

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Fecundity:</mark> the ability to produce more of the same experiences

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Purity:</mark> the extent that pleasure is not diluted by pain

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Extent:</mark> number of beings affected

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Act Utilitarianism:</mark>

        - Add up change in happiness of all affected beings

            - If Sum > 0, action is good

            - If Sum < 0, action is bad

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Case for Act Utilitarianism:</mark>

        - Focuses on happiness

        - Down-to-earth (practical)

            - Utilitarian calculus provides a straightforward way to determine the right course

            - Start by identifying the set of possible alternatives

            - For each alternative, total up the anticipated positive and negative consequences

            - Identifying the alternative with the maximum total

            - Can help a diverse group of people to come to a collective decision

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Case for Act Utilitarianism:</mark>

        - Unclear whom to include in calculations

        - Too much work to come to each decision

        - Ignores our innate sense of utility

        - Susceptible to the problem of moral luck, where actions do not have intended consequences

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Rule Utilitarianism:</mark>

        - We ought to adopt moral rules which, if followed by everyone, will lead to the greatest increase in total happiness

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Act Utilitarianism</mark> applies principle of utility to individual actions

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Rule Utilitarianism</mark> applies principle of utility to moral rules

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Case for Rule Utilitarianism:</mark>

        - Compared to act utilitarianism, it is easier to perform the utilitarian calculus

        - Not every moral decision requires performing utilitarian calculus

        - Moral rules survive exceptional situations

        - Avoids the problem of moral luck

        - Workable ethical education

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Case against utilitarianism in general:</mark>

        - All consequences must be measured on a single scale

            - All units must be the same in order to do the sum

            - In certain circumstances, utilitarianism must quantify the value of a human life

        - Utilitarianism ignores the problem of an unjust distribution of good consequences

            - Utilitarianism does not mean "the greatest good of the greater number"

            - That requires a <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Principle of Justice</mark>

        - What happens when a conflict arises between the <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Principle of Utility</mark> and <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Principle of Justice</mark>?

- <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Social Contract Theory:</mark>

    - Philosopher Thomas Hobbes (1603—1679) wrote in 'Leviathan':

        - "Without rules, nobody would create anything of value!"

        - Life would be in a state of nature i.e. "solitary, poore, nasty, brutish and shod'

        - Rational people understand that rules are necessary for meaningful cooperation to take place

    - Therefore we implicitly accept a social contract

        - Establishment of moral rules to govern relations among citizens

        - Government capable of enforcing these rules

    - Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712—1778) evolved the theory in his book 'Social Contract'. He identified the critical problem facing society is:

        - How to find an association that guarantees safety...

        - Yet enable each person to remain free?

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Answer:</mark>

        - Everybody gives themselves & their rights to the whole community

        - Allows the community to determine the rules for members

        - Each then obliged to obey these rules

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Caveat:</mark>

        - In ideal society, no one above rules

        - Thus preventing society from enacting bad rules

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">James Rachel's Definition:</mark>

        - "Morality consists in the set of rules, governing how people are to treat one another, that rational people will agree to accept, for their mutual benefit, on the condition that others follow those rules as well."

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Social Contract Theory vs. Kantianism:</mark>

        - Both based on universal moral norms derived through a rational process

        - Differs in how we decide whether a moral rule is ethical

        - Social Contract Theory holds that it is right for me to act according to a moral rule if rational people would collectively accept it as binding because of its benefits to the community

        - Hobbes, Locke and other philosophers held that all moral beings had certain rights e.g. life, liberty & prosperity

        - Also these rights should be balanced against duties for others e.g. right of life v. duty for others not to kill you

        - Social Contract provides for systems of laws and systems of enforcements

        - Being selfish in not paying your taxes results in punishment

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Based on Rights:</mark>

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Negative right:</mark> A right that another can guarantee by leaving you alone

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Positive right:</mark> A right obligating others to do something on your behalf

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Absolute right:</mark> A right guaranteed without exception

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Limited right:</mark> A right that may be restricted based on the circumstances

        - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Correlation between Types Of Rights:</mark>

            - Positive rights tend to be more limited

            - Negative rights tends to be more absolute

    - The utilitarian standpoint allows an unequal distribution of a certain amount of utility is better than an equal distribution of a lesser amount of utility.

    - While Social contract theory recognizes the harm that a concentration of wealth and power can cause.

    - According to Rousseau, "the social state is advantageous to men only when all possess something and none has too much"

    - Each person may claim a "fully adequate" number of basic rights and liberties, so long as these claims are consistent with everyone else having a claim to the same rights and liberties

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">John Rawls's Principles of Justice:</mark>

        - Any social and economic inequalities must be:

        - associated with positions that everyone has a fair and equal opportunity to achieve

        - to the greatest benefit of the least-advantaged members of society (the difference principle)

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Case for Social Contract Theory:</mark>

        - Framed in language of rights

        - Explains why people act in self-interest without common agreement

        - Provides clear analysis of certain citizen/government problems

        - Explains why breaking bad laws is the right course of action

        - Workable ethical theory

    - <mark style="background:#FF5582A6;">Case Against Social Contract Theory:</mark>

        - No one signed contract

        - Some actions have multiple characterisations

        - Conflicting rights problem

        - E.g. abortion

        - May unjustly treat people who cannot uphold contract

        - Rights in retum for bearing certain burdens

        - Some choose to break rules others cannot help breaking rules

        - Generally society tries to distinguish between these types

        - Not all people can bear these burdens e.g. drug addicts
