* Computer networks are generally comprised of numerous pieces of hardware and software
* Recall the previous attempt to "model" how these components interconnect and interact with each other
* ![](https://i.imgur.com/pERkopl.png)
* Whilst this horizontal model is useful when looking at hardware components, the reality is that it does not explain everything.
* From previous discussions on: <mark style="background: #69E772;">Data Link Control, LANs technologies, Internetworking </mark> etc. much of the functionality required to provide communications between host machines is not necessarily provided on a single hardware component as suggested by the previous slide
* The purpose of each layer is to provide <mark style="background: #69E772;">one</mark> component of  the overall solution to the <mark style="background: #69E772;">“Communications Problem”</mark> such  as “frame reception/transmission” etc.
* These layers of software can exist on: separate hardware components and/or hosts or, in some instances multiple layers can exist on a single hardware component and/or hosts

* This concept is not dissimilar to the approach used  for software development:
	* Objects or libraries are used to perform specific operations.
	* Importantly the object/library function keeps details of its internal state and algorithms hidden from the main program.
 
* The same approach is used for network protocol software:
	* Each layer of software provides one part of the solution such  as: frame transmission/reception or, transmitting one/zeros  onto a wire/wireless transmission medium etc.
	
* With networking software, the layers of protocol  software are organised into a Stack:
	* Each layer sits between other layers as shown in the next slide.
	* Each layer is said to offer services to higher layers and to use the services offered by the lower layers.

* <mark style="background: #69E772;">Protocol Hierarchies - Terminology:</mark>
	
	* <mark style="background: #69E772;">Protocol/Protocol Entity:</mark> A software module that performs one sub-task such as: frame transmission/reception etc.
	* <mark style="background: #69E772;">Protocol suites/stack:</mark> A number of such software modules that work together to perform all of the tasks required to enable two hosts communicate.
	* <mark style="background: #69E772;">Protocol Architectures/Model:</mark> A model by which we can categorise or view the different protocol layers.
	* The following slide provides an analogy to the Communications Problem:
		* How can two CEOs communicate with each other effectively and efficiently?

* <mark style="background: #69E772;">The OSI ISO Reference (7 layer model):</mark>
	
	* Communications between computer hosts presents the same challenges.
	* The OSI model deals with connecting <mark style="background: #69E772;">open</mark> systems: i.e. systems that are <mark style="background: #69E772;">open</mark> for communication with <mark style="background: #69E772;">other</mark> systems  regardless of who built them or how they were manufactured.
	
	* The principles that were applied to arrive at the seven layers are as follows: 
		* Each layer was created when a different <mark style="background: #69E772;">level of abstraction</mark> was required.
		* Each layer performs one well-defined function with each function chosen carefully to facilitate the development of <mark style="background: #69E772;">standardised protocols</mark>.
		* The number of layers chosen was sufficient enough to ensure that distinct functions were not <mark style="background: #69E772;">lumped</mark> together to become unwieldy.
		
	* The layers of software work together in unison to provide overall solutions to the problems of communicating between host computers across complex networks.
	
	* <mark style="background: #69E772;">Information</mark> flows across each of the interfaces (boundaries) between the layers:
		* These boundaries were carefully defined to <mark style="background: #69E772;">minimise</mark> information flow across the interfaces.
		* The following slides discuss the functionality of each layer of protocol software. This functionality should be recognisable from previous discussions.

* <mark style="background: #69E772;">The 7 layer Model: Layer-by-layer:</mark>
	
* <mark style="background: #69E772;">The Physical Layer (Layer 1):</mark> 
	* Concerned with  transmitting <mark style="background: #69E772;">raw</mark> bits over a <mark style="background: #69E772;">communication channel</mark>:
	* Its purpose is to ensure that the transmission of binary 1s and 0s adheres to what is appropriate for the transmission medium and what is expected by the <mark style="background: #69E772;">receiver</mark>.
	
	* Primarily it deals with matters such as: What voltage levels are used? What frequencies are used? How long does it take to transmit a bit (Bit Duration)? etc. 
	
	* There are certain design issues to address such as: the <mark style="background: #69E772;">mechanical</mark> and <mark style="background: #69E772;">electrical</mark> design of the plugs and sockets, <mark style="background: #69E772;">timing interfaces</mark>, the physical <mark style="background: #69E772;">transmission medium</mark> etc
	
* <mark style="background: #69E772;">The Data Link Layer (Layer 2):</mark>
	
	* Concerned with the successful transmission of data across an individual link.
	* Its purpose is to transforms a <mark style="background: #69E772;">raw</mark> transmission facility into a <mark style="background: #69E772;">data communications channel</mark> that <mark style="background: #69E772;">appears</mark> free of transmission errors.
	* Primarily it deals with matters such as the transmission/reception of <mark style="background: #69E772;">data frames</mark>. 
	* There are certain design issues to address such as: the creation of localised unique addressing, the creation of a unique framing structure, flow control, error control, controlling access to a <mark style="background: #69E772;">shared</mark> channel etc.
	
* <mark style="background: #69E772;">The Network Layer (Layer 3):</mark>
	
	* Concerned with the successful delivery of data between hosts across complex network infrastructures:
	* Its purpose is to control the operation of the <mark style="background: #69E772;">sub-networks</mark> to achieve host-to-host delivery.
	* Primarily it deals with matters such as the routing of <mark style="background: #69E772;">packets</mark> from the <mark style="background: #69E772;">source</mark> station towards the <mark style="background: #69E772;">destination</mark> station across sub-nets etc. 
	* There are certain design issues to address such as: the creation a globally unique address space, the creation of a globally unique framing structure.
	* Essentially this layer is responsible for managing data communications across interconnected <mark style="background: #69E772;">heterogeneous</mark> networks.
	
* <mark style="background: #69E772;">The Transport Layer (Layer 4):</mark>
	*  This is a key layer. 
	* It is a true <mark style="background: #69E772;">end-to-end</mark> layer responsible for the reliable delivery of data between <mark style="background: #69E772;">processes</mark> on end-host machines i.e. process-to-process delivery:
	* Its purpose is to provide a reliable data transport service to applications.
	* Primarily it deals with interfacing with applications for the purpose of exchanging data between applications across a network.
	* There are certain design issues to address such as: multiplexing data streams from/to remote applications, data loss, network latency etc.
	
* <mark style="background: #69E772;">Data Flows:</mark>
	
	* The layers work together to provide the complete functionality required to facilitate communications between two remotely connected host machines regardless of how they connect to the internet.
	* The following slide shows how data flows between the layers (up-and-down):
	* Note that sometimes it is necessary to break up the data to meet some size restrictions associated with some lower layer protocol software. Recall use of <mark style="background: #69E772;">Fragmentation</mark> at the Network layer.

* <mark style="background: #69E772;">Data Flows:</mark>
	
	* Some of the layers are also implemented on intermediary networking devices such as Routers:
	* This is because the functionality associated with these layers is needed for a particular purpose such as: frame reception / transmission, packet routing etc.
	* The following slide shows how the complete set of layers are implemented on the end-hosts as well as on the intermediary networking devices.
