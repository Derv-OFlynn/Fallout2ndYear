- 
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Local Area Networks:</mark>
    
    - These are private communications networks:
    - They are are used to interconnect the computing resources within an organisation
    - All devices attach to a shared transmission medium. They can provide data rates up to 1 Gbps
    
    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">The rationale for interconnecting devices:</mark>
        - Proliferation of computing devices,
        - Growth in Multimedia applications,
        - Increase in client/server application
        
    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">LANs can be classified according to:</mark>
        - Their topology e.g. ring, star, bus
        - The type of transmission medium used e.g. ThickNet, Thinnet
        - How they access the shared Tx medium (aka as Access Control) e.g. CSMA, Token
        
    
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">There are three broad types of LANs:</mark>
    
    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">PC LANs (aka Access Layer):</mark>
        - Used to connect low-cost devices e.g. PCs, small server devices, etc
        - Used in most organisations
        - These LANs are cheap to implement and maintain, consequently their performance and speed is low
        
    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Backend LANs (aka Core Layer):</mark>
        - Used to connect high-cost devices e.g. Mainframes, Supercomputers, mass storage devices
        - Mainly used for the bulk transfer of data
        - Used in large organisations
        - These LANs are costly to implement and maintain, consequently their performance and speed is high
        
    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Backbone LANs (aka Distribution Layer):</mark>
        - Used to provide connectivity between PC LANs and backend LANs
        
    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">The use of a single LAN is not desirable:</mark>
        - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Reliability:</mark> If the single LAN develops a fault the effects can be devastating
        - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Capacity:</mark> More devices connecting to LAN reduces its performance
        - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Cost:</mark> Connecting low-cost PC devices using the same type of LAN used to connect High Cost server devices would be impractical
        
    
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">LAN topologies:</mark>
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/f9KYSM8.png)
	
	
    - There are three LAN topologies to consider: <mark style="background:#69E772;">Bus</mark>, <mark style="background:#69E772;">Ring</mark> and <mark style="background:#69E772;">Star</mark>.
    
    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Bus LAN characteristics:</mark>
        - A <mark style="background:#69E772;">linear</mark> transmission medium is used
        - Each station attaches to the bus using a tap
        - There are no closed loops
        - Transmissions travel in both directions i.e. <mark style="background:#69E772;">bi-directional</mark>, and can be seen by <mark style="background:#69E772;">every</mark> attached device
        - The bus is terminated by a <mark style="background:#69E772;">terminator</mark> device which removes the transmission signal.
        - Example of a bus LAN is an <mark style="background:#69E772;">ethernet</mark>
        
    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Ring LAN characteristics:</mark>
        - Consists of a set of interconnected <mark style="background:#69E772;">repeaters</mark> (using point to point links) in a <mark style="background:#69E772;">ring</mark> configuration
        - Repeaters receive data on one link and transmit them <mark style="background:#69E772;">bit-by-bit</mark> onto another link
        - These links are <mark style="background:#69E772;">uni-directional</mark>
        - Each station attaches at a <mark style="background:#69E772;">repeater</mark>
        - The transmission signal must be <mark style="background:#69E772;">physically</mark> removed from the network
        - Example of a ring LAN is the <mark style="background:#69E772;">IBM Token Ring</mark>
        
    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Star LAN characteristics:</mark>
        - Consists of a central <mark style="background:#69E772;">hub</mark> component of which there are two types:
            - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Shared-medium</mark> hub
            - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Switched-LAN</mark> hub
            
        - Each station is attached by two links (<mark style="background:#69E772;">transmit</mark> and <mark style="background:#69E772;">receive</mark>)
        - All transmissions travel via the Hub device
        - Example of a star LAN is an ATM
        
    
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Common Characteristics of LANs:</mark>
    
    - Data is transmitted in small blocks known as <mark style="background:#69E772;">frames</mark>.
    - Each frame contains <mark style="background:#69E772;">Data</mark> plus <mark style="background:#69E772;">Control Information</mark> (similar to HDLC)
    - Stations must gain access to the shared medium transmission
    - Access must be provided on a fair and equitable basis i.e. there must be some controlling mechanism employed
