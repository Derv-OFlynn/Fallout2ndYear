- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Problems with LAN technologies:</mark>

    - From previous discussions on LANs there are a variety of <mark style="background:#69E772;">networking</mark> technologies available to facilitate communications between host computers:

    - For any given LAN implementation, host computers can only communicate with other hosts attached to the <mark style="background:#69E772;">same</mark> networking technology.

    - It is not unreasonable to assume that many organisations may employ a variety of <mark style="background:#69E772;">technologies</mark>.

    - This is usually for historical reasons due to mergers and take-overs etc.

    - Historically this can lead to the creation of <mark style="background:#69E772;">islands</mark> of networks within organisations:

    - Difference in frame formats, Electrical characteristics (voltages, wiring types, etc.) and Addressing Schemes prevented <mark style="background:#69E772;">direct</mark> communications between hosts connected to different LAN technologies

    - Today, there is a need to facilitate communication between any two hosts regardless of the type of LAN they attach to

    - This is similar to telephone systems which facilitate communication between any two telephones. For example between a mobile phone and a fixed-line phone

    - This is known as universal service and is a fundamental concept within networking

- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Universal Service:</mark>

    - With <mark style="background:#69E772;">Universal Service</mark>: A user on any host in any part of an organization can send messages or data to any other user without any knowledge of the underlying networking technology.

    - Whilst highly desirable <mark style="background:#69E772;">universal service</mark> can be difficult to achieve due to incompatibilities between network technologies.

    - The provision of <mark style="background:#69E772;">Universal Service</mark> for host computers requires addressing the problems associated with <mark style="background:#69E772;">heterogeneous</mark> (multiple) network technologies:

    - The introduction of <mark style="background:#69E772;">Internetworking</mark> technology is the solution.

- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Universal Service through Internetworking:</mark>

    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Internetworking introduces a new hardware component and new software :</mark>

        - Additional hardware is needed to provide a physical interconnection between LANs for the purpose of routing traffic:

        - This hardware needs a physical connection to each LAN using the correct NIC.

        - Only then can it route and deliver traffic between LANs.

    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Additional software is also required to:</mark>

        - Address the <mark style="background:#69E772;">lack of</mark> uniqueness when using MAC addresses,

        - Address the <mark style="background:#69E772;">lack of</mark> summary routing when using MAC addresses,

        - Introduce a single, unique <mark style="background:#69E772;">“framing”</mark> structure/format understood by all hosts.

    - The result is a system of connected physical networks known as an <mark style="background:#69E772;">internetwork</mark> or <mark style="background:#69E772;">internet</mark> as shown in the next slide.

    - There is no restriction on the size of an <mark style="background:#69E772;">internet</mark>. However, there are reliability, efficiency and performance issues to consider when designing and/or attaching to an internet

- <mark style="background:#69E772;">An example of a small internet:</mark>

- <mark style="background:#69E772;">An example of a larger internet:</mark>

- <mark style="background:#69E772;">The Hardware components - Routers:</mark>

    - The hardware component is called a <mark style="background:#69E772;">Router</mark>.

    - It is a special purpose computer used for <mark style="background:#69E772;">interconnecting</mark> networks:

    - It is like any host computer in that it contains: a CPU, RAM, I/O interfaces (Network Interface Cards) etc.

    - Whilst the previous diagram shows a router connecting only two networks; in practise a single router can connect many LANs.

    - Also, many organisations use <mark style="background:#69E772;">multiple</mark> routers to maximise performance and to allow for <mark style="background:#69E772;">redundancy</mark>.

    - To provide <mark style="background:#69E772;">universal service</mark> the routers must physically pass data between the LANs

- <mark style="background:#69E772;">The Software Component - Internet Protocol (IP):</mark>

    - As already discussed, passing data directly between different <mark style="background:#69E772;">LANs</mark> technologies is impossible due to differing <mark style="background:#69E772;">frame formats</mark> and <mark style="background:#69E772;">addressing schemes</mark>.

    - Internet <mark style="background:#69E772;">protocol software</mark> addresses these issues by:

    - Introducing a <mark style="background:#69E772;">single</mark> globally-unique addressing scheme:

    - This single scheme hides the underlying <mark style="background:#69E772;">multiplicity</mark> of physical addressing schemes (recall static, dynamic and configurable MAC addresses) employed on each LAN.

    - Introducing a <mark style="background:#69E772;">single</mark> “framing” structure called a “Packet/Datagram” that is understood by <mark style="background:#69E772;">all</mark> host computers.

- <mark style="background:#69E772;">The IP Datagram/Packet:</mark>

- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Internetworking technology - Providing Universal Service for Host Computers:</mark>

    - The routers combined with the internet protocol software makes universal access possible.

    - However, internets are really an abstraction

    - No such network exists in reality consequently they are often called virtual networks.

    - We will now examine the concepts behind interworking.

    - Firstly, we will look at the globally unique addressing scheme design especially for interworks.

    - Secondly, we will look at the role played by the router in delivering data across different network technologies.
