- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Hardware Addressing:</mark>

    - LAN technologies facilitate sharing of information between <mark style="background:#69E772;">all</mark> locally connected stations

    - Direct communication between specific pairs of stations is achieved using an <mark style="background:#69E772;">addressing scheme</mark>

    - Each station is assigned a <mark style="background:#69E772;">UNIQUE</mark> address called a <mark style="background:#69E772;">Hardware Address</mark> or a <mark style="background:#69E772;">MAC Address</mark>

    - An example of an Ethernet MAC address is: <mark style="background:#69E772;">00:40:05:1c:0e:9f</mark>

    - Ethernet MAC addresses are 48-bit long and are usually represented in Hex format; 12 Hex digits, each digit representing 4 bits

- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Hardware Addressing in Frames:</mark>

    - The header within each transmitted frame contains the addresses of the sender and receiver

    - This allows the LAN interface card (<mark style="background:#69E772;">Network Interface Card</mark> aka <mark style="background:#69E772;">NIC</mark>) to filter out frames without conferring with the CPU:

    - The NIC only interrupts the CPU when it has data specific to the station

    - All other frames are discarded

- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Hardware Addressing Allocation:</mark>

    - Different addressing schemes are employed on different LAN topologies.

    - Each station’s address must be unique on the LAN to which it connects.

    - Address allocation falls into three categories:

        - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Static:</mark> The h/w manufacturer sets the address

        - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Dynamic:</mark> Stations sets their address at boot-up

        - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Configurable:</mark> The admin sets the address

- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Types of Communication:</mark>

    - There are three types of communication possible on a LAN:

        - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Unicast:</mark> This is station-to-station communication.

        - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Broadcast:</mark> This is station-to-ALL stations communications.

        - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Multicast:</mark> This is station-to-SOME station communications.

    - Each type of communication requires its own address.

    - Unicast communication requires the use of unique MAC addresses. All NICs are configured with a unique MAC address.

    - Broadcast communication requires one address to be recognised by all stations: All NICs are configured to recognised the broadcast address of all ones (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF)

    - Multicast communications require one address to be recognised by some stations.
