- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Extending the reach of LANs:</mark>

    - Where there is a need to <mark style="background:#69E772;">extend</mark> or <mark style="background:#69E772;">interconnect</mark> LANs <mark style="background:#69E772;">three</mark> devices can be used:
    - 
    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Repeaters:</mark>

        - Used to interconnect identical LANs i.e. LANs using the <mark style="background:#69E772;">same</mark> MAC protocols (e.g. conforming to IEEE 802.3 or 802.5 etc.).

        - Repeaters do <mark style="background:#69E772;">not</mark> process frames.

    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Bridges:</mark>

        - Used to interconnect LANs that use <mark style="background:#69E772;">similar</mark> or <mark style="background:#69E772;">different</mark> MAC protocols (e.g. IEEE 802.3 and/or 802.5 etc.).
        - Bridges <mark style="background:#69E772;">do</mark> process frames.

    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Routers:</mark>

        - Similar to bridges but with extra functionality i.e. used to interconnect <mark style="background:#69E772;">different</mark> LAN technologies. To be examined later under the topic <mark style="background:#69E772;">Internetworking</mark>

- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Repeaters:</mark>

    - Repeaters are used to overcome the distance limitation of LANs:

        - Recall that transmission signals attenuate over distance.

        - The length of a LAN segment is restricted to address attenuation e.g. a 10Base5 LAN has a length restriction of 500m.

        - When there is a need to interconnect stations beyond this distance, a <mark style="background:#69E772;">Repeater</mark> can be used.

    - A Repeater connects <mark style="background:#69E772;">segments</mark> of a LAN: It does <mark style="background:#69E772;">not</mark> connect two LANs i.e. unique addressing is still required.

    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Basic functionality:</mark>

        - Repeaters regenerate attenuated bits. For each bit received a fresh signal is reproduced.

        - Repeaters forward every frame without filtering.

- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Bridges:</mark>

    - Bridges facilitate the interconnection of <mark style="background:#69E772;">small</mark> LANs to create <mark style="background:#69E772;">one</mark> large LAN: This is preferable to creating a single large LAN.

    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Advantages of using small interconnected LANs:</mark>

        - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Reliability:</mark> The effects of a fault can be contained and restricted to only a few stations.

        - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Performance:</mark> Smaller LANs provide better performance to <mark style="background:#69E772;">locally</mark> attached devices. This ties in with the <mark style="background:#69E772;">Principal of Locality of Reference</mark>:

        - The <mark style="background:#69E772;">majority</mark> of traffic is often between <mark style="background:#69E772;">locally</mark> connected stations

        - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Security:</mark> With some LAN topologies such as Bus and Wireless LANs <mark style="background:#69E772;">all</mark> stations can potentially see <mark style="background:#69E772;">all</mark> frames. The use of a Bridge facilitates the <mark style="background:#69E772;">physical</mark> isolation of high security traffic <mark style="background:#69E772;">and</mark> users with special security access.

        - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Geography:</mark> It facilitates extending a LAN to isolated clusters of stations using long distance communications links e.g. microwave links, satellite links etc.

    - Bridges can interconnect more than 2 LANs.

- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Bridge Implementation:</mark>

- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Functions of a bridge:</mark>

    - Basic Bridges only understand one frame format e.g. 802.3, 805.5 etc. These are sometimes called MAC Relay Bridges.

    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Store and Forward Functionality:</mark>

        - Operating in <mark style="background:#69E772;">promiscuous</mark> mode a Bridge reads all frames transmitted on one LAN.

        - It <mark style="background:#69E772;">retransmits</mark> frames to an outgoing port to which another LAN is connected only if the destination station is on that LAN.

        - The <mark style="background:#69E772;">retransmission</mark> is done <mark style="background:#69E772;">without modification</mark> to the frame i.e. <mark style="background:#69E772;">bit-by-bit</mark>.

        - This function is performed in <mark style="background:#69E772;">both</mark> directions.

    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Routing and Addressing:</mark>

        - Not all frames are copied. Only those relevant to a particular LAN segment are copied. This implies a routing capability.

        - The use of a bridge does not affect how stations communicate with each other:

        - Unique MAC addresses are used for routing frames between stations connected to the same bridged network.

        - A routing strategy is used to decide which frames are forwarded onto another LAN.

        - There are two routing strategies to consider:

            - Fixed routing.

            - Address Learning

- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Fixed Routing Strategy:</mark>

    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Fixed routing:</mark>

        - For each pair of source-destination station a route is created in a routing table stored on the bridge.

        - Based on the destination address in a received MAC frame the bridge performs a lookup of the routing table to determine if the frame is to be forwarded.

    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Advantages/Disadvantages of fixed routing:</mark>

        - Simplicity. Requires minimal processing overhead. However, this can become very complicated if multiple bridges are used.

        - Requires a lot of manual intervention when more stations/bridges are added or removed.

- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Example Bridge Routing Table:</mark>

- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Address Learning Routing Strategy:</mark>

    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Address Learning</mark> is an alternative approach to routing. Here the Bridge can <mark style="background:#69E772;">learn</mark> the location of each station <mark style="background:#69E772;">automatically</mark> because:

        - Each incoming MAC frame contains a <mark style="background:#69E772;">source address</mark> field.

        - Each LAN attaches to one <mark style="background:#69E772;">port</mark> only.

    - Using both of these identifiers the bridge constructs <mark style="background:#69E772;">a routing table</mark> automatically i.e. without manual intervention

    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Address learning starts at boot-up time:</mark>

        - Initially the routing table is empty.

        - As MAC frames arrive on any of the incoming ports the Bridge constructs the routing table using the source MAC address/source port information.

    - After a period of time known as the <mark style="background:#69E772;">steady-state</mark> period the table is complete: <mark style="background:#69E772;">Frame filtering</mark> can commence in earnest.

- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Address Learning Process:</mark>

    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/8wXqOQB.png)


- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Address Learning Routing Strategy:</mark>

    - Bridges that use an address learning strategy are known as <mark style="background:#69E772;">Transparent Bridges</mark>:

    - Stations connected to the LAN are unaware of the existence of the bridge.

    - A problem with Transparent Bridges is <mark style="background:#69E772;">Looping</mark>:

        - Arises from the use of <mark style="background:#69E772;">redundant bridges</mark>,

        - Redundant bridges are often used for reliability in the event that one bridge fails; another bridge can take over.

    - Redundant bridges can create loops within the network as follows

    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/C0q83ir.png)


- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Overcoming Bridging Loops:</mark>

    - Graph theory is used to create a loop-free bridge network:

    - A <mark style="background:#69E772;">Spanning Tree</mark> is a graph in which there is no loop.

    - To create a <mark style="background:#69E772;">Spanning Tree</mark> the network is represented as a graph:

        - Here the graph <mark style="background:#69E772;">nodes</mark> represent the bridges and the LANs to which they connect,

        - The connecting <mark style="background:#69E772;">arcs</mark> represent the connections between a LAN(s) and a bridge(s),

        - Each arc is a assigned a <mark style="background:#69E772;">cost metric</mark> (‘1’ in the direction of a bridge to a LAN and, ‘0’ for the opposite direction)

    - An example bridged network:

    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/3PEGQ8C.png)

    - Finding the Spanning Tree involves three steps:

        - Identify the <mark style="background:#69E772;">Root Bridge</mark>. The bridge with the lowest value ID (usually the Bridge serial number) is designated the Root bridge,

        - Find the <mark style="background:#69E772;">shortest path</mark> from the Root Bridge to every other bridge and LAN in the network,

        - Eliminate redundant routes. The routes with the shortest paths become the spanning tree.

    - All bridge ports in the spanning tree are marked as <mark style="background:#69E772;">forwarding ports</mark>:

    - All other ports are marked as <mark style="background:#69E772;">blocking ports</mark>.

- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Advantages of using Bridges:</mark>

    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Parallelism:</mark>

        - Not every frame arriving at the bridge is copied to another LAN:

        - This allows for two pairs of stations to communicate simultaneously provided each pair is on a separate LAN and separated by a bridge.

    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Optimised performance:</mark>

        - Stations that are likely to communicate with each other frequently can be moved to the same LAN to ensure adherence to the Principal of Locality of Reference.

        - Collision Domains are smaller, reducing the likelihood of collisions occurring

- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Optimised performance and Parallelism:</mark>

    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/4VKqfL1.png)


    - Without bridging each station perceives the speed of the LAN as:

    - (LAN Data Rate) / (number of stations).

    - This is significantly improved with bridging.

- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Collision Domains are reduced in size:</mark>

    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/9i8QjAH.png)


    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">With</mark> bridging the size of the collision domain is reduced and contention is therefore reduced.

- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Summary of Bridges:</mark>

    - Used to extend LANs creating small interconnected LANs rather than a single large LAN.

    - Can connect LANs with similar <mark style="background:#69E772;">or</mark> different MAC protocols.

    - Contains <mark style="background:#69E772;">Routing</mark> functionality to <mark style="background:#69E772;">filter</mark> frames:

        - This facilitates parallelism which in turn improves performance of each connected LAN

        - Also, collisions are not copied between LANs which reduces the Collision Domain and improves contention ratio.

    - Contains <mark style="background:#69E772;">Store</mark> and <mark style="background:#69E772;">Forward</mark> functionality:

        - Facilitates connecting fast, busy LANs to slow LANs.
