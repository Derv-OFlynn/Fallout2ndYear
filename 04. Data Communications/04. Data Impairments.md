- A transmitted signal becomes distorted due to <mark style="background:#69E772;">transmission impairments</mark>
- For <mark style="background:#69E772;">Analogue</mark> signals, the quality can become <mark style="background:#69E772;">degraded</mark>
- For <mark style="background:#69E772;">Digital</mark> signal, <mark style="background:#69E772;">bit errors</mark> can be introduced

- Types of Impairment:
    - Attenuation and Attenuation distortion
    - Noise
    
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Attenuation and Attenuation distortion:</mark>
    
    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Attenuation</mark> - where the signal becomes weaker over distance
    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Attenuation</mark> is a function of <mark style="background:#69E772;">frequency</mark>
    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Attenuation distortion</mark> affects the <mark style="background:#69E772;">intelligibility</mark> of the received signal, especially <mark style="background:#69E772;">signal pulses</mark> which can become distorted
    - One technique for addressing this problem is to use equalising amplifiers. This boosts higher frequency components which evens out signal pulses

- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Noise:</mark>
    
    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Noise</mark> is the insertion of unwanted signals onto the transmission signal. Its effect is to distort the signal during transmission (refer to diagram on slide entitled Effects of Impulse and Thermal Noise)
    - It particularly affects digital signals, the greater the noise the greater the <mark style="background:#69E772;">bit error rate</mark>
    
    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Three categories of Noise:</mark>
        - Thermal Noise
        - Cross talk
        - Impulse Noise
        
    
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Thermal Noise:</mark>
    
    - Caused by the thermal agitation of electrons within a conductor
    
    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Characteristics:</mark>
        - Present in all electronic devices and conductors
        - It is a function of <mark style="background:#69E772;">temperature</mark> i.e. increased temperature leads to increase in thermal noise
        - It is uniformly distributed across frequency spectrum, also known as <mark style="background:#69E772;">white noise</mark>
        
    - The presence of Thermal Noise places an upper limit on the data carrying capacity of a transmission system
        - Must ensure that the strength of the data-carrying signal is much greater than the noise signal
        - Term used to describe this relationship is <mark style="background:#69E772;">SNR</mark> (Signal to Noise Ratio)
        
    
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Cross Talk:</mark>
    
    - Unwanted <mark style="background:#69E772;">coupling</mark> between signals on neighbouring transmission paths
        - The term <mark style="background:#69E772;">coupling</mark> means connecting without actually touching
        - Coupling can occur between cables in close proximity or between radio signals close to the same frequency
        
    
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Impulse Noise:</mark>
    
    - Irregular pulses or <mark style="background:#69E772;">noise spikes</mark> of short duration and high amplitude
    
    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Causes:</mark>
        - Lightning and heavy static charges
        - Switching of heavy electrical loads
        - Faults within the transmission system
        
    - Analogue signals are less affected by this type of noise, e.g. a voice transmission, whilst affected by impulse noise, can still be received intelligibly
    - Digital signals are very susceptible, it can lead to corruption of data i.e. changing one to zero and vice versa

- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Channel Capacity:</mark>
    
    - Channel capacity allows us to study the inter-relationships between Signal BW, System BW and Signal Impairments
    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Channel Capacity</mark> is the maximum rate at which data can be transmitted over a communications path or channel
    - The objective is to make the best use of a given bandwidth/channel, however channel capacity is limited in practice by transmission impairments of which the main constraint is <mark style="background:#69E772;">noise</mark>
    - Two distinguished scientists on this topic: Nyquist and Shannon
    
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Nyquist's Noise Free Channel:</mark>
    
    - According to Nyquist, the limitation on data rate is simply the bandwidth of the channel
    
    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Nyquist's theorem:</mark>
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/27E61eO.png)
		
        - <mark style="background:#69E772;">C</mark> = Maximum data rate measured in bits per sec
        - <mark style="background:#69E772;">B</mark> = Bandwidth of the transmission system Hz
        - <mark style="background:#69E772;">M</mark> = Number of discrete states in digital signal
        
    
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Limitation on Channel Capacity:</mark>
    
    - It appears from Nyquist's theorem that any data rate is achievable by:
        - Increasing the bandwidth of the system
        - Encoding more bits per cycle
        
    - However, as the Data Rate increases:
        - The <mark style="background:#69E772;">bit error rate</mark> increases
        - It becomes more and more difficult for the receiver to distinguish different signal <mark style="background:#69E772;">states</mark>
        
    - Noise and other transmission impairments put a practical limit on M, hence the maximum Data Rate achievable
    
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Noise and Data Rate:</mark>
    
    - Noise distorts a signal during transmission
    - The greater the noise the greater the bit error rate for digital signals
    - Key factor is Signal to Noise Ration (SNR)
    - Measured in Decibels

    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">S</mark> = Average signal power
    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">N</mark> = Average noise power
    
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Shannon's Noisy Channel:</mark>
    
    - Shannon extended Nyquist's work and took into account the effects of <mark style="background:#69E772;">noise</mark>
    - Shannon's Capacity Formula:
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/rBu9A21.png)
    
    - <mark style="background:#69E772;">Observations:</mark>
        - Increasing the bandwidth increases the maximum data rate
        - Increasing the noise reduces the maximum data rate
        - Shannon's Law defines an upper limit on the achievable data rate
        - Hence the data rate is limited by <mark style="background:#69E772;">bandwidth</mark> and <mark style="background:#69E772;">noise</mark>
        
    
- <mark style="background:#69E772;">Limitation on Channel Capacity:</mark>
    
    - According to Shannon the maximum data rate achievable is determined by:
        - The bandwidth of the system/channel and,
        - The noise on the channel
        - i.e. every system/channel has a maximum data carrying capacity that cannot exceeded
        
    - This is a more practical and realistic reflection on Channel Capacity as it takes into consideration the effects of noise
